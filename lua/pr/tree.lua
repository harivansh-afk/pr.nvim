-- pr.tree: the working-tree half of the flow - where a PR becomes real files.
--
-- Every other module here reads REFS. A PR's diff is computed from
-- origin/pr/N without touching your checkout, which is what makes reviewing
-- free: it never disturbs what you were doing. It is also the limit of that
-- approach, because a ref is not a file. Nothing that needs a real file on
-- disk works against one - not an LSP (rust-analyzer indexes a cargo
-- workspace, not a blob), not fugitive, not gitsigns.
--
-- So <CR> on a file row materialises the PR as a git WORKTREE and opens the
-- real file out of it. rust-analyzer, fugitive and gitsigns then see the PR
-- exactly as its author does - the thing itself, not a rendering of it.
--
-- A worktree and not a checkout, which is the whole point: your own tree is
-- never touched, so reviewing works mid-edit, on a dirty tree, without
-- stashing, and HEAD stays where you left it. `.worktrees/pr-<N>` is the same
-- repo-local convention (and the same gitignore entry) everything else here
-- uses.
--
-- Always DETACHED at the commit under review. Reviewing is reading, and there
-- is no branch named "commit 3 of 5". The division of labour is deliberate:
--   <CR>  read the PR at this commit   -> worktree, detached, never disturbs you
--   C     work on the PR               -> your tree, real branch, upstream set
--
-- Worktrees are cheap but not free, so `:PR clean` removes them.
--
-- NOT re-pointed at the PR's base for gitsigns, deliberately: in the worktree
-- HEAD *is* the PR commit, so the gutter is empty, and the obvious fix does not
-- work. gitsigns.change_base is a no-op in this version - measured against
-- `git diff --numstat` ground truth, 0 hunks for a +30/-18 file, in BOTH the
-- buffer-local and global forms and in the main checkout as well as a worktree,
-- so it is upstream and not about worktrees. The PR's diff is one command away
-- inside the worktree anyway (`:Git diff <base>...HEAD`), and pr://files is
-- already showing it. Revisit if gitsigns fixes change_base.
